# economy-population
#This repo contains code, images, and csv files to facilitate the analysis of United States GDP & population data from the period
#2013-2018. The analysis took the following steps, in such order:
#         1) Find reliable datasets from reliable sources (e.g. census.gov (population); Bureau of Economic Analysis (economic))
#         2) Extract, clean & manipulate data to facilitate analysis with Pandas in Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb files)
#         3) Discuss theoretical relationships and manipulate data to validate, following threads of interesting trends found
#         4) Deliberate on prioritization for sharing with the class, as well as optimal visualizations
#         5) Execute planned analyses and visualizations and compile into slide deck (.ipynb files)
#         6) Present

#This project challenged us in various ways, not least in workload for the sudden and unfortunate attrition of a colleague due to health #reasons. Through this project we used the following tools & technologies:
#         1) Python 
#         2) Pandas & Matplotlib visualizations
#         3) Jupyter Notebook
#         4) Git & Github
#         5) APIs
#         6) Interactive Charts, (e.g. heatmaps)

# In this repo one may find the code we used as well as select outputs.
